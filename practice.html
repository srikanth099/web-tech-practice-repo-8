<P>
    Dhitva is a combination of two words, Dhi - “Understand/Imagination”, Tattva - “Principle/Experience” 
As our name implies, we believe that imagination and understanding are the fundamental principles of learning.
(Understanding through experience) 
We at Dhitva want to bring the latest technology to Kindle imagination. Dhitva embarks on new-age technology like AR,
VR and mixed reality to simplify the concepts and make learning fun, engaging and interesting. 

VR can assist in transforming students from passive spectators to more active participants in the learning process. 
Students may go risk-free to the distant reaches of the planet or to "impossible"
regions like the subatomic world to experiment with physics. Virtual reality may also channel a student's energy, passion, and curiosity into new ways of learning.
